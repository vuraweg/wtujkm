## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive enhancements to the resume preview system with exact PDF representation, additional sections support, reorganized section ordering, and robust export functionality.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Resume Preview with Sticky Right-Side Panel ✅

**New Components Created:**
- `ResumePreviewControls.tsx` - Zoom controls (zoom in, zoom out, fit to width, full screen)
- `FullScreenPreviewModal.tsx` - Full-screen preview with independent zoom controls

**Layout Changes in ResumeOptimizer.tsx:**
- Implemented two-column grid layout (left: export settings, right: sticky preview)
- Added sticky positioning for preview panel on desktop (`lg:sticky lg:top-6`)
- Preview panel now includes:
  - Zoom controls with percentage display
  - Independent scrolling
  - Transform-based scaling for accurate representation
  - Max height constraint: `max-h-[calc(100vh-250px)]`

**Features:**
- Zoom range: 50% to 200%
- Real-time zoom percentage display
- Fit to width button for quick reset
- Full-screen mode for distraction-free viewing
- Responsive design: collapses to single column on mobile

### 2. Additional Sections Support ✅

**ResumePreview.tsx Updates:**

### 3. Section Order Reorganization ✅

**Skills Section Now Appears First (After Summary/Objective)**

**Updated in ResumePreview.tsx:**
```typescript
// Experienced users:
['summary', 'skills', 'workExperience', 'projects', 'certifications', 'education']

// Students:
['careerObjective', 'education', 'skills', 'projects', 'workExperience', 'certifications', 'achievementsAndExtras']

// Freshers:
['careerObjective', 'education', 'skills', 'projects', 'workExperience', 'certifications', 'achievementsAndExtras']
```

**Updated in PDF Export (exportUtils.ts):**
- Experienced: Skills → Work Experience → Projects → Certifications → Education
- Students: Education → Skills → Projects → Work Experience → Certifications → Achievements
- Freshers: Education → Skills → Work Experience → Projects → Certifications → Achievements
