14. Ensure all language is direct, professional, and free of jargon unless it's industry-standard and relevant to the JD.
15. Penalize any section (WORK EXPERIENCE, PROJECTS, INTERNSHIPS) that lacks proper formatting or content quality:

    - Inconsistent date formats
    - More than 3 bullets per item
    - Bullets that do not begin with action verbs
    - No quantified metrics
    - Disorganized or incomplete structure
