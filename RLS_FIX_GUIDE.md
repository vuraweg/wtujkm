# RLS Policy Fix - Job Listings Creation

## Problem Solved

The error "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'job_listings'" has been fixed.

### Root Cause
The admin user `primoboostai@gmail.com` existed in the database but did not have the admin role properly set in either:
- `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
- `user_profiles.role`

This caused the RLS policies to reject job creation attempts, even though the user should have admin privileges.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Admin Role Granted
- Set `role = 'admin'` in `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data` for primoboostai@gmail.com
- Set `role = 'admin'` in `user_profiles` table for the same user
- Verified both settings are synchronized

### 2. Improved `is_current_user_admin()` Function
Updated the admin check function to be more robust:
- First checks `user_profiles.role` for admin status
- Falls back to checking `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data->>'role'`
- Handles null values gracefully
- Returns false if user is not authenticated

### 3. Recreated RLS Policies
Rebuilt all RLS policies on `job_listings` table:
- **Public SELECT**: Anyone can view active job listings
- **Admin SELECT**: Admins can view all job listings (including inactive)
- **Admin INSERT**: Only admins can create new job listings
- **Admin UPDATE**: Only admins can update job listings
- **Admin DELETE**: Only admins can delete job listings

### 4. Added Debug Function
Created `debug_admin_status()` function to help troubleshoot admin issues:
```sql
SELECT debug_admin_status();
```
Returns:
- Current user ID and email
- Profile role from user_profiles table
- Metadata role from auth.users table
- Whether user is considered admin
- Whether user profile exists

## Next Steps

### For the Current Admin User
1. **Log out** of the application completely
2. **Log back in** with `primoboostai@gmail.com`
3. The session will now have admin privileges
4. Navigate to the job upload form
5. You should now be able to create job listings successfully

### Testing Job Creation
1. Go to `/admin/jobs/new` (or your job upload route)
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - Company name
   - Role title
   - Domain
   - Location type
   - Experience required
   - Qualification
   - Short description (50+ chars)
   - Full description (100+ chars)
   - Application link
3. Click "Create Job Listing"
4. The job should be created successfully without RLS errors

### Adding More Admins in the Future

#### Method 1: Using SQL (Recommended)
Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor, replacing the email:
```sql
-- Grant admin role
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_user_meta_data = COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb) || '{"role": "admin"}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'new-admin@example.com';

-- Update user profile
INSERT INTO user_profiles (id, full_name, email_address, role, is_active)
SELECT
  id,
  COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data->>'name', split_part(email, '@', 1)),
  email,
  'admin',
  true
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'new-admin@example.com'
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  role = 'admin',
  profile_updated_at = now();
```

#### Method 2: Using Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Authentication â†’ Users
2. Find the user to promote
3. Click to open user details
4. Edit "Raw User Meta Data"
5. Add or update: `{"role": "admin"}`
6. Save changes
7. User must log out and log back in

#### Method 3: Using Admin Functions (Once Logged In)
If you implement the admin management UI, you can use:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('grant_admin_role', {
  target_user_id: 'user-uuid-here'
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting RLS Errors?

1. **Verify admin status**:
```sql
SELECT debug_admin_status();
```

2. **Check user exists in both tables**:
```sql
SELECT
  u.id,
  u.email,
  u.raw_user_meta_data->>'role' as metadata_role,
  up.role as profile_role
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON u.id = up.id
WHERE u.email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

3. **Force session refresh**:
   - Log out completely
   - Clear browser cache/cookies
   - Log back in

4. **Verify RLS policies**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'job_listings';
```

### Session Not Updating After Role Change?

The session contains cached user metadata. After changing a user's role:
1. The user MUST log out
2. The user MUST log back in
3. The new session will include the updated role

### Profile Not Syncing?

If `user_profiles` doesn't have the admin role but `auth.users` does:
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET role = (
  SELECT raw_user_meta_data->>'role'
  FROM auth.users
  WHERE auth.users.id = user_profiles.id
)
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users
  WHERE raw_user_meta_data->>'role' = 'admin'
);
```

## Security Notes

1. **Admin privileges are powerful** - Only grant to trusted users
2. **Change default password** - The password in ADMIN_SETUP.md should be changed
3. **Monitor admin actions** - Consider adding audit logging
4. **Regular reviews** - Periodically review who has admin access
5. **Principle of least privilege** - Don't create more admins than necessary

## Database Schema Reference

### user_profiles.role
- Type: `text`
- Values: `'client'` (default) or `'admin'`
- Indexed for performance
- Checked by RLS policies

### auth.users.raw_user_meta_data
- Type: `jsonb`
- Should contain: `{"role": "admin"}` for admin users
- Synced to user_profiles on signup/update
- Used as fallback in admin checks

## Files Modified

1. **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_fix_admin_rls_policies.sql`
   - Improved `is_current_user_admin()` function
   - Recreated all job_listings RLS policies
   - Added `debug_admin_status()` helper function

2. **Database Changes**:
   - Updated admin role for primoboostai@gmail.com
   - Ensured user_profiles record exists with admin role

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Review Supabase logs in the dashboard
3. Run `SELECT debug_admin_status();` to see current auth state
4. Verify the migration was applied successfully
