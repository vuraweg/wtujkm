# Admin Privileges Fix - Complete Guide

## Problem Overview

You were encountering the error **"Failed to verify admin privileges. Please contact support."** when trying to upload job listings through the admin panel.

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:
1. The admin role verification system was not properly configured
2. The `is_current_user_admin()` function may not have existed or was not functioning correctly
3. RLS (Row Level Security) policies on the `job_listings` table were not properly set up
4. There may have been a mismatch between the admin role in `auth.users` metadata and `user_profiles` table

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Migration (`20251002083525_fix_admin_privileges_final.sql`)

A comprehensive migration has been created that:

✅ **Ensures the `role` column exists** in `user_profiles` table
✅ **Grants admin role** to `primoboostai@gmail.com` in both:
   - `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
   - `user_profiles.role`
✅ **Creates/updates admin check functions**:
   - `is_current_user_admin()` - Checks if current user is admin with fallback logic
   - `debug_admin_status()` - Returns detailed diagnostic information
   - `verify_admin_access()` - Tests admin permissions
✅ **Recreates all RLS policies** on `job_listings` table with clear logic
✅ **Adds helper view** `admin_users_view` to see all admin users and their sync status

### 2. Improved Error Handling (`jobsService.ts`)

Enhanced the `createJobListing` function with:

✅ **Detailed diagnostic logging** at every step
✅ **Better error messages** that explain what went wrong
✅ **Specific troubleshooting guidance** based on error type
✅ **Comprehensive admin status checking** using `debug_admin_status()`

### 3. Admin Debug Panel (`AdminDebugPanel.tsx`)

Created a new troubleshooting component that:

✅ **Shows real-time admin status** with visual indicators
✅ **Displays detailed diagnostics** including:
   - Authentication status
   - Profile existence
   - Profile role
   - Metadata role
   - Diagnosis with actionable feedback
✅ **Provides test buttons** to verify admin access
✅ **Shows raw metadata** for advanced debugging

### 4. Integration with Job Upload Form

The Admin Debug Panel is now integrated into the Job Upload Form:

✅ **Visible at the top** of the upload page
✅ **Collapsible** to save screen space
✅ **Real-time status checking** before form submission

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply the Database Migration

The migration file has been created at:
```
supabase/migrations/20251002083525_fix_admin_privileges_final.sql
```

**If you're using Supabase CLI:**
```bash
supabase db push
```

**If you're using Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the contents of the migration file
5. Click **Run** to execute

### Step 2: Clear Your Session

After applying the migration:

1. **Log out** from the PrimoBoost AI application
2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Chrome: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
   - Select "Cookies and other site data" and "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"
3. **Close all browser tabs** with the application
4. **Open a new browser window**
5. **Log back in** with your admin account (`primoboostai@gmail.com`)

### Step 3: Verify Admin Access

Once logged back in:

1. Navigate to **Admin Panel** → **Upload Job Listing**
2. At the top of the page, you'll see the **Admin Debug Panel**
3. Click **"Check Admin Status"**
4. Verify that:
   - ✅ "Admin Access Verified" shows with green checkmark
   - ✅ Profile Role shows "admin"
   - ✅ Metadata Role shows "admin"
   - ✅ All status indicators are green

### Step 4: Test Job Upload

If all checks pass:

1. Fill in the job listing form
2. Click **"Create Job Listing"**
3. The job should be created successfully

## Troubleshooting

### If Admin Status Check Still Fails

#### Option A: Manual Database Fix

Run these queries in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Check current status
SELECT
  up.id,
  up.email_address,
  up.role as profile_role,
  au.raw_user_meta_data->>'role' as metadata_role
FROM user_profiles up
JOIN auth.users au ON au.id = up.id
WHERE up.email_address = 'primoboostai@gmail.com';

-- 2. If role is not 'admin', run this:
UPDATE user_profiles
SET role = 'admin', profile_updated_at = now()
WHERE email_address = 'primoboostai@gmail.com';

UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_user_meta_data = COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb) || '{"role": "admin"}'::jsonb
WHERE email = 'primoboostai@gmail.com';

-- 3. Verify the fix
SELECT is_current_user_admin();
SELECT debug_admin_status();
```

#### Option B: Test Functions Exist

```sql
-- Check if functions exist
SELECT routine_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name IN ('is_current_user_admin', 'debug_admin_status', 'verify_admin_access');

-- If any are missing, re-run the migration
```

#### Option C: Check RLS Policies

```sql
-- View all policies on job_listings
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'job_listings';

-- Should show these policies:
-- - public_can_view_active_jobs (SELECT)
-- - admins_can_view_all_jobs (SELECT)
-- - admins_can_insert_jobs (INSERT)
-- - admins_can_update_jobs (UPDATE)
-- - admins_can_delete_jobs (DELETE)
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "User not found" | User doesn't exist in auth.users | Sign up first with primoboostai@gmail.com |
| "Profile missing" | No user_profiles record | Log out and log back in to trigger profile creation |
| "Role mismatch" | Metadata says admin but profile doesn't | Run manual database fix queries above |
| "Policy violation" | RLS policies not working | Re-run migration or check policies manually |
| "Function not found" | Admin functions missing | Re-run migration to create functions |

## Verification Queries

Use these to verify everything is set up correctly:

```sql
-- 1. Check admin users
SELECT * FROM admin_users_view;

-- 2. Get your admin status
SELECT debug_admin_status();

-- 3. Test admin function
SELECT is_current_user_admin();

-- 4. Verify policies
SELECT policyname, permissive, roles, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'job_listings'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- 5. Check user profile
SELECT id, email_address, role, is_active
FROM user_profiles
WHERE email_address = 'primoboostai@gmail.com';
```
